**EXPLANATION**

P5JS, is a 'graphics based' Javascript framework library, which one  first downloads;   
then, adds to the HTML web page by including a couple of script tags;  
it will then transform that web page into being a canvas that you can use to draw on;  
you can use all different sorts of shapes, including:     

-> point  
-> line  
-> rectangle  
-> circle  
-> ellipse  
-etc.  

You can also colour in using...

background(r,g,b); //...fills in the background of the shape  
fill(r,g,b);       //...fills the inside of the shape in  
stroke(r,g,b);     //...colours in the shape outline  

**NOTE**: RGB, can be any value within the number range: 0-255.  

You can also do drawing with the mouse using...  

ellipse(mouseX,mouseY,sizeX,sizeY);
